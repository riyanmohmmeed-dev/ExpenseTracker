# Resume & GitHub project ideas (IIT / hackathon / international student style)

Short list of **unique, problem-solving** project ideas that stand out on a resume or GitHub profile. Each is the kind of thing that shows initiative, real-world impact, and technical depth — similar to what strong candidates (e.g. IIT, hackathon winners, top schools) often highlight.

---

## 1. **DocMind** — AI contract & document intelligence

- **What**: Upload contracts/documents; AI extracts clauses, parties, dates, obligations, and risk highlights. Search and compare versions.
- **Why it stands out**: Combines **document parsing**, **LLM integration**, and **domain logic** (legal/compliance). Shows you can ship a “product feature” (not just a demo) with clear use case.
- **Stack**: .NET (or Node) backend, React/Next.js frontend, OpenAI/Azure OpenAI, optional vector DB for semantic search.
- **Resume line**: *“Built an AI-powered document intelligence tool that extracts key clauses and risks from contracts using LLMs and structured parsing, with version comparison and search.”*

## 2. **CampusNav** — Accessibility-first campus / building navigator

- **What**: Indoor + outdoor navigation for campuses (or malls/hospitals) with **accessibility modes**: wheelchair routes, low-vision cues, step-free paths, elevator-first. Optional: AR/voice cues.
- **Why it stands out**: **Inclusive design**, **real impact** for students with disabilities. Hackathons and universities love “accessibility + tech.”
- **Stack**: React Native or Flutter (mobile), Node/.NET API, GeoJSON/indoor maps, optional ML for crowd or obstacle hints.
- **Resume line**: *“Designed and built an accessibility-first campus navigation app with wheelchair- and low-vision modes, using indoor/outdoor mapping and structured route metadata.”*

## 3. **EduMatch** — Skill-based peer learning matcher

- **What**: Students mark what they want to learn and what they can teach. System matches peers (study buddies) and suggests micro-groups. Optional: integration with LMS or calendar.
- **Why it stands out**: **Solves a real campus problem** (finding the right study partner), shows **matching/recommendation** logic and possibly **notifications/scheduling**.
- **Stack**: Next.js or React + Node/.NET, PostgreSQL, optional WebSockets for live availability, or Cal.com-style scheduling.
- **Resume line**: *“Built a peer-learning platform that matches students by skills and goals, with scheduling and group suggestions to improve study outcomes.”*

## 4. **GreenLedger** — Carbon footprint tracker for daily choices

- **What**: Log meals, transport, purchases; estimate carbon impact using open datasets (e.g. food DB, transport factors). Dashboards, goals, and simple “what-if” scenarios (e.g. switch to bus vs car).
- **Why it stands out**: **Sustainability + data** is a strong theme at hackathons and for ESG-minded companies. Shows **data modeling**, **APIs**, and **UX** for a concrete cause.
- **Stack**: React or Flutter, .NET/Node API, PostgreSQL, external APIs or static datasets for emission factors.
- **Resume line**: *“Developed a personal carbon footprint tracker with meal and transport logging, emission factor integration, and goal-based dashboards to encourage low-carbon choices.”*

## How to pick one

- **Backend / API focus** → DocMind or GreenLedger (clear APIs, data models, optional AI).
- **Mobile / UX / social impact** → CampusNav or EduMatch (strong story for demos and interviews).
- **AI/LLM** → DocMind (or add an “explain this clause” / “summarize” feature to another idea).

Keep the **first version small**: one user flow end-to-end, then add one standout feature (e.g. “compare two contract versions” or “wheelchair-only route toggle”). That’s enough to list on a resume and demo in 2–3 minutes.
